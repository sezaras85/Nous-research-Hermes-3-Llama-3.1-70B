# Nous-research-

Nous Research is a leader in the development of human-centric language models and simulators.  there primary focus areas include model architecture, data synthesis, fine-tuning, and reasoning, all aimed at aligning AI systems with real-world user experiences. its prioritize the development of open-source, human-compatible models, which challenge the conventional closed-model approach. 

This project started out of curiosity ‚Äî to better understand how Hermes-3 might one day connect with the broader Nous Protocol, possibly through on-chain inference or smart contract integration.
Ideas, improvements, or just playing around? PRs welcome!
This repo is community-driven. Let's explore the future of decentralized AI together.

# üß† Hermes-3 Terminal Chatbot (Nous Research API)

A simple CLI-based chatbot using the powerful `Hermes-3-Llama3-70B` model from [Nous Research](https://nousresearch.com/).  
Built for testing, learning, and exploring the capabilities of Hermes-3 via its official inference API.
